HZActionableMaskTransition allows you to create trasition for an alpha mask.
the mask can be manipulated using an Action to create cool effects.

Actions currently supported are those who affect Position, Scale and rotation.

Creating a new Transition is easy as subclassing HZActionableMaskTransition 
and setting the proper Mask and Action, just take a look at MyMaskTransition.m for an example.
